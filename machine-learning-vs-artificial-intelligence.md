# Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two closely related terms that are often used interchangeably. However, there is a subtle difference between the two.

Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

In other words, AI is the umbrella term, while machine learning is a specific technique that can be used to achieve AI.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between AI and machine learning:

| Feature      | Artificial Intelligence                                                                                                                   | Machine Learning                                                                                                                         |

| Examples     | Self-driving cars, virtual assistants, fraud detection                                                                                    | Spam filtering, image recognition, product recommendations                                                                               |
| How it works | AI algorithms are typically programmed with a set of rules or instructions. They then use these rules to process data and make decisions. | Machine learning algorithms are trained on data. They learn to identify patterns in the data and use these patterns to make predictions. |
