# Machine Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two closely related terms that are often used interchangeably. However, there is a subtle difference between the two.

* Artificial intelligence is a broad term that refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
* Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

In other words, AI is the umbrella term, while machine learning is a specific technique that can be used to achieve AI.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between AI and machine learning:

| Feature      | Artificial Intelligence                                                                                                                   | Machine Learning                                                                                                                         |

| How it works | AI algorithms are typically programmed with a set of rules or instructions. They then use these rules to process data and make decisions. | Machine learning algorithms are trained on data. They learn to identify patterns in the data and use these patterns to make predictions. |

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to remember that machine learning is just one tool in the AI toolbox. There are many other AI techniques that can be used to achieve similar results.

Here are some examples of how machine learning is being used today:

| Use Case                    | Machine Learning Application                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image recognition           | Machine learning is used to train algorithms that can identify objects in images. This technology is used in a variety of applications, such as facial recognition, object detection, and medical image analysis. |
| Speech recognition          | Machine learning is used to train algorithms that can understand human speech. This technology is used in a variety of applications, such as voice assistants, dictation software, and call centers.              |
| Natural language processing | Machine learning is used to train algorithms that can understand and process human language. This technology is used in a variety of applications, such as machine translation, chatbots, and spam filters.       |
|Predictive analytics         | Using historical data to predict future outcomes|
|Fraud detection              | Identifying fraudulent transactions|

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field, and there is no doubt that it will continue to play an increasingly important role in our lives in the years to come.
